But they're absolutely essential for creating PHP applications that work well, are easy to work with, maintainable, optimized. and don't cause security headaches and


## Core Principles

### 1. Does It Do the Job? Code Functionality Check

The most important aspect of a code review is making sure the code fulfils its intended purpose. Let's focus on the code's logic. Trace the flow of execution from the moment it receives input to the output it produces. Look for any illogical steps, incorrect calculations, or places where the process might unexpectedly stop.

- **Check the inputs**: Does the code properly handle all types of data it might receive? This includes user input, data from databases, or information from external systems.
- **Inspect the outputs**: Verify that the results produced by the code are both correct and in the expected format. Does the output data match the requirements?

Thorough testing is key to ensuring functionality. Unit tests help us systematically check individual components of the code with different input variations, ensuring the code behaves as expected in all scenarios.

During this step, I find it helpful to be able to release the code to a review app or staging server, and confirm my findings in code review with how it actually works. For tricky parts, I also tend to search for added Unit tests. If they are missing, it's probably a good idea to ask the author to add them.
