# Benchmarking

## Overview 
When developing applications in any language, writing tests is only part of the equation; understanding how to measure performance can offer trans-formative insights into your codeâ€™s efficiency.

Benchmarking involves measuring the time taken by functions or operations to determine their speed under certain conditions. This practice helps identify bottlenecks and optimize them for better performance.

## Why Benchmark?

- Uncover slow-running code paths.
- Compare different implementation strategies.
- Verify the impact of changes over time.
