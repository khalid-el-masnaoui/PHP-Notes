# PHP Code Review Best Practices

## Overview

Think of a code review as the quality assurance process for your PHP project. To safeguard the integrity and longevity of your application, we need a multi-faceted approach, They Â can sometimes feel a bit tedious. But they're absolutely essential for creating PHP applications that work well, are easy to work with, maintainable, optimized. and don't cause security headaches and


## Core Principles

### 1. Does It Do the Job? Code Functionality Check

The most important aspect of a code review is making sure the code fulfils its intended purpose. Let's focus on the code's logic. Trace the flow of execution from the moment it receives input to the output it produces. Look for any illogical steps, incorrect calculations, or places where the process might unexpectedly stop.

- **Check the inputs**: Does the code properly handle all types of data it might receive? This includes user input, data from databases, or information from external systems.
- **Inspect the outputs**: Verify that the results produced by the code are both correct and in the expected format. Does the output data match the requirements?

Thorough testing is key to ensuring functionality. Unit tests help us systematically check individual components of the code with different input variations, ensuring the code behaves as expected in all scenarios.

During this step, I find it helpful to be able to release the code to a review app or staging server, and confirm my findings in code review with how it actually works. For tricky parts, I also tend to search for added Unit tests. If they are missing, it's probably a good idea to ask the author to add them.

### 2. Does It Work as Designed? Focusing on Code Functionality

At the core of a solid code review, we need to answer one fundamental question: does this code do what it's supposed to do? Begin by comparing the code directly with the project's requirements or specifications. Have you implemented all the necessary features? Are there incorrect behaviours or anything missing? Next, step through the code's logic carefully. Does the execution follow a sensible path from the input received to the final output? Look for any nonsensical branching (like if statements that are always false), infinite loops, or potential crashes.

Inspect how the code handles all forms of input. Will it work with different user entries, varied data pulled from a database, or information coming from another system? And just as importantly, is the output correct, formatted properly, and aligned with what the rest of your application anticipates?

**Technical Tip**: Don't just test by clicking around the application. While developers bear the primary responsibility for writing unit tests, don't underestimate the value of a critical eye during code review. As a reviewer, look for:

- **Missing Tests**: Are there blocks of code without corresponding unit tests?
- **Edge Cases**: Do the tests cover only expected scenarios, or do they include unexpected inputs and boundary conditions?
- **Test Quality**: Are the tests well-written and do they clearly assert the expected outcomes?

When reviewing, imagine ways a user could deliberately (or accidentally) try to break the code. Can you feed it strange inputs, cause unusual sequences of events, or overload it? Resilient code should handle these scenarios gracefully. With a tool like Xdebug. It lets you pause code execution, step through it line-by-line, and closely examine the values of variables as things change.
