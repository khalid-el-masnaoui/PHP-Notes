# PHP SPL

## Overview

The **Standard PHP Library (SPL)** is a collection of built-in interfaces, classes, and functions that enhance PHP’s OOP capabilities.


## Standard PHP Library (SPL)

The Standard PHP Library (SPL) is a collection of interfaces and classes that are meant to solve common programming challenges.

SPL aims to implement some efficient data access interfaces and classes for PHP. Functionally, it is designed to traverse aggregate structures (anything you want to loop over).

Despite its utility, the SPL remains underutilized by many in the PHP community.


Key features of SPL include:

- **Data Structures:** Pre-built classes for handling `stacks`,` queues`, and `heaps`
- **Iterators:** Objects that allow for **memory-efficient** looping over large datasets 
- **Observers and Subjects:** Implementation of the **Observer Design Pattern** for event-driven programming 
- **File Handling Enhancements:** More powerful tools for working with directories and file streams 

By embracing SPL, we can **write cleaner, faster, and more maintainable code**.
