# Software Testing

Software testing is a crucial process within the software development lifecycle that involves evaluating a software application to identify bugs, errors, and missing requirements. Its primary goal is to ensure the software functions correctly, securely, and efficiently according to its specifications and user expectations.



# Software Testing

## Key Aspects

- **Verification and Validation:**  Testing verifies that the software meets its specified requirements and validates that it fulfills the intended purpose and user needs.
    
- **Bug Detection:**  It aims to uncover defects, errors, or inconsistencies in the software's behavior compared to its expected output.
    
- **Quality Assurance:**  Testing contributes to delivering a high-quality product by improving reliability, usability, and performance.
    
- **Risk Mitigation:**  By identifying and addressing issues early, testing helps minimize the risks of software failure and negative user experiences.


## Testing Types

Software testing can be broken out into two different types: **functional** and **non-functional** testing. Different aspects of a software application require different testing types, such as **performance** testing, **scalability** testing, **integration** testing, **unit** testing, and many more.
Each of these software testing types offers excellent visibility into your application, from code to user experience.

### Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual units or components of code in isolation. These units can be functions, methods, or classes, typically representing the smallest testable parts of an application. The key principle of unit testing is to isolate each unit from the rest of the codebase and verify its behavior independently.

 **Characteristics of Unit Tests:**
 
1. **Isolation**: Unit tests are independent and isolated from external dependencies such as databases, network calls, or other components.
2. **Granularity**: They target specific units of code, allowing for fine-grained testing of functionality.
3. **Speed**: Unit tests are fast to execute since they do not rely on external resources or interactions

### Component Tests

Component tests, also known as module tests, sit between unit tests and integration tests in terms of scope. While unit tests focus on individual units of code, component tests validate the interactions and integration between multiple units or components within a module or subsystem.
