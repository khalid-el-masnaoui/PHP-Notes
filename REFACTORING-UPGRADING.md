# PHP Refactoring and Upgrading

As a software engineer, you should always look for ways to improve your code.Applications must be regularly updated and maintained.

Refactoring and Upgrading  are distinct but often **intertwined** processes aimed at improving the quality, maintainability, and performance of a PHP application.


## PHP Refactoring

### Introduction 

Refactoring is a systematic process of restructuring and improving code without changing its external behavior. The main goal of refactoring is to make the code more maintainable, easier to understand, and less prone to bugs. Some of the benefits of refactoring include:

- Reducing code complexity and improving readability
- Eliminating duplicate code and reducing the risk of bugs
- Making it easier to add new features and functionality
- Improving overall performance and efficiency
- Enhancing code reusability and maintainability

You may want to refactor a legacy code-base (involving upgrading as well), or a modern co-debase using best practices and clean code guidelines.

### Techniques for Refactoring PHP Code

Several techniques can be applied to refactor PHP code. Some of the most common methods include:

#### 1. Extracting Functions and Methods

One common problem in PHP code is long functions or methods that perform multiple tasks. This can make the code difficult to understand and maintain. To refactor this code, you can extract smaller functions or methods from the existing code.

For example, consider the following PHP code:

```php
protected function handle()
{
    $url = $this->option('url') ?: $this->ask('Please provide the URL for the import:');
    
    $importResponse =  $this->http->get($url);

    $bar = $this->output->createProgressBar($importResponse->count());
    $bar->start();

    $this->userRepository->truncate();
    collect($importResponse->results)->each(function (array $attributes) use ($bar) {
        $this->userRepository->create($attributes);
        $bar->advance();
    });

    $bar->finish();
    $this->output->newLine();

    $this->info('Thanks. Users have been imported.');
    
    if($this->option('with-backup')) {
        $this->storage
            ->disk('backups')
            ->put(date('Y-m-d').'-import.json', $response->body());

        $this->info('Backup was stored successfully.');
    }
  
}
```


This function does multiple tasks, making it difficult to understand and maintain. We can refactor it by extracting smaller functions for each task:

```php
protected function handle()
{
    $url = $this->option('url') ?: $this->ask('Please provide the URL for the import:');
    
    $importResponse =  $this->http->get($url);
    
    $this->importUsers($importResponse->results);
    
    $this->saveBackupIfAsked($importResponse);
}

protected function importUsers($userData): void
{
    $bar = $this->output->createProgressBar(count($userData));
    $bar->start();

    $this->userRepository->truncate();
    collect($userData)->each(function (array $attributes) use ($bar) {
        $this->userRepository->create($attributes);
        $bar->advance();
    });

    $bar->finish();
    $this->output->newLine();

    $this->info('Thanks. Users have been imported.');
}

protected function saveBackupIfAsked(Response $response): void
{
    if($this->option('with-backup')) {
        $this->storage
            ->disk('backups')
            ->put(date('Y-m-d').'-import.json', $response->body());

        $this->info('Backup was stored successfully.');
    }
}
```
