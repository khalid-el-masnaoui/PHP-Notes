# Software Testing

Software testing is a crucial process within the software development lifecycle that involves evaluating a software application to identify bugs, errors, and missing requirements. Its primary goal is to ensure the software functions correctly, securely, and efficiently according to its specifications and user expectations.



# Software Testing

## Key Aspects

- **Verification and Validation:**  Testing verifies that the software meets its specified requirements and validates that it fulfills the intended purpose and user needs.
    
- **Bug Detection:**  It aims to uncover defects, errors, or inconsistencies in the software's behavior compared to its expected output.
    
- **Quality Assurance:**  Testing contributes to delivering a high-quality product by improving reliability, usability, and performance.
    
- **Risk Mitigation:**  By identifying and addressing issues early, testing helps minimize the risks of software failure and negative user experiences.


## Testing Types

Software testing can be broken out into two different types: **functional** and **non-functional** testing. Different aspects of a software application require different testing types, such as **performance** testing, **scalability** testing, **integration** testing, **unit** testing, and many more.
Each of these software testing types offers excellent visibility into your application, from code to user experience.
