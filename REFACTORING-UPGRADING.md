# PHP Refactoring and Upgrading

As a software engineer, you should always look for ways to improve your code.Applications must be regularly updated and maintained.

Refactoring and Upgrading  are distinct but often **intertwined** processes aimed at improving the quality, maintainability, and performance of a PHP application.


## PHP Refactoring

### Introduction 

Refactoring is a systematic process of restructuring and improving code without changing its external behavior. The main goal of refactoring is to make the code more maintainable, easier to understand, and less prone to bugs. Some of the benefits of refactoring include:

- Reducing code complexity and improving readability
- Eliminating duplicate code and reducing the risk of bugs
- Making it easier to add new features and functionality
- Improving overall performance and efficiency
- Enhancing code reusability and maintainability

You may want to refactor a legacy code-base (involving upgrading as well), or a modern co-debase using best practices and clean code guidelines.
